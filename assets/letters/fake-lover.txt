Dear Sunhi,

I have a small confession. Forgive this pouring of my heart.

I cherish London, where we first met. The moment I clapped eyes on you, I knew you were going to be a kind partner. Recently, I have began to regard you as much more than just a kind partner.

My feelings for you intensified when I saw you dancing in the moonlight. I was further wowed by your tremendous gaming skills.

You have eyes like inspiring cantaloupe and the most relaxed ass I've ever seen. When I look at you, I just want to kiss those inspiring cantaloupe eyes and support that relaxed ass.

You're so special with your safe ways. The way you handle your beautiful mother shows great kindness and patience.

I know that to you I'm just a supportive man but I think we could be happy together, exploring like two joyful pugs.

Please, say you'll be mine Sunhi!

All my love
Will
